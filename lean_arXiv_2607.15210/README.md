# Lean verification for arXiv:2607.15210

Proof sources and numerical certificates for *Counterexamples to additivity of
minimum output p-Rényi entropy of quantum channels for all p ≥ 0*.

**Verification summary.** The finite-dimensional, analytic, entropy, and
dimension-182 spectral estimates have Lean proofs. The random-channel limits
and channel-existence conclusions have Lean proofs **assuming one remaining
theorem: block-modified strong convergence for Haar projections when k ≥ 2**.
Its full statement appears [below](#remaining-unverified-theorem), with a
[folder documenting the partial formalization](partial_progress/).

Every result in the tables links to its declarations, assumptions, and **all
related Lean files**. Proof sources are grouped by topic in [lean/](lean/);
[Python checks](python/) and [verification records](verification/) have separate folders.

## Install and verify

Install Git, Bash, Python 3.11 or newer with `venv`, and Lean's toolchain manager
[elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan#installation). On Windows, use WSL.

```sh
curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
# Open a new terminal after installation, then:
git clone https://github.com/pxwu24/superadditivity-of-classical-communication.git
cd superadditivity-of-classical-communication
bash lean_arXiv_2607.15210/verify-all.sh
```

The project selects Lean **4.19.0** and the pinned Mathlib dependency
automatically. To recheck an existing installation:

```sh
bash lean_arXiv_2607.15210/verify-all.sh --no-setup
```

This rebuilds every maintained Lean source, audits all declarations, and runs
the Python checks. Only the standard Lean axioms `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
and `Quot.sound` are allowed. A successful build checks the stated hypotheses;
it does not prove the remaining convergence theorem.

## Results verified without the remaining theorem

<!-- RESULT_TABLE_END -->

The dimension-182 certificate proves the strict limiting spectral inequality.
The finite-channel consequence uses the convergence theorem below, and the
bound is **k_high(1) ≤ 182**; minimality of 182 is not asserted.

## Verified deductions from the remaining theorem

The following proofs are complete as deductions from the single stated
convergence input. Their random-channel conclusions are therefore conditional
until that input is formalized.

## Remaining unverified theorem

The remaining input is **block-modified strong convergence for Haar projections, for fixed output dimension $k\ge2$**. The precise part used in the paper is the following.

Fix $k\ge2$, $t\in(0,1)$, and integers $0\le d_n\le nk$ such that $d_n/(nk)\to t$. Let $P_n$ be independent Haar-distributed orthogonal projections of rank $d_n$ on $\mathbb C^n\otimes\mathbb C^k$. For a fixed $V\in\mathcal U(k)$ and $a\in\mathbb R^k$, write

$$
Q_n^V=(I_n\otimes V^*)P_n(I_n\otimes V)
      =\sum_{i,j=1}^k Q_{ij}^{(n,V)}\otimes E_{ij},
\qquad
S_n^V(a)=\sum_{i=1}^k a_iQ_{ii}^{(n,V)}.
$$

For $\varphi_a(X)=\mathrm{Tr}(\mathrm{diag}(a)X)I_k$, the block-modified matrix is $(\mathrm{id}_n\otimes\varphi_a)(Q_n^V)=S_n^V(a)\otimes I_k$.

Put $b_t=(1-t)\delta_0+t\delta_1$, and let $D_c$ denote dilation by $c$. There is a compactly supported probability measure

$$
\mu_{a,t}=\boxplus_{i=1}^k
              \bigl(D_{a_i/k}b_t\bigr)^{\boxplus k}
$$

such that, for every fixed $c\in\mathbb R$, almost surely,

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} ||cI_n+S_n^V(a)||_\infty
=\max_{x\in\mathrm{supp}\,\mu_{a,t}}|c+x|.
$$

For every fixed bounded continuous $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, almost surely,

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac1n\sum_{j=1}^n
 f\bigl(\lambda_j(S_n^V(a))\bigr)
=\int_{\mathbb R}f(x)\,d\mu_{a,t}(x).
$$

The same deterministic measure is used in both limits. In the precise Lean interface, the probability-one event may depend on the fixed choices $V,a,c$ or $V,a,f$.

The law is specified analytically, without assuming its spectral edge. Its $R$-transform is

$$
R_{\mu_{a,t}}(w)=\sum_{i=1}^k a_iR_{b_t}(a_iw/k),
\qquad
R_{b_t}(w)=
\frac{w-1+\sqrt{(1-w)^2+4tw}}{2w},
\quad R_{b_t}(0)=t.
$$

Precisely, the record requires a compact probability measure whose Cauchy transform $G(z)=\int(z-x)^{-1}\,d\mu_{a,t}(x)$ satisfies $G(z)^{-1}+R_{\mu_{a,t}}(G(z))=z$ for all sufficiently large positive $z$ and all sufficiently large negative $z$.

This is the affine-norm and weak-spectral part of the usual strong-convergence theorem; it is exactly the part required by the downstream proofs. The formal proposition is [`ProjectionChannels.FullBlockModifiedStrongInput`](lean/RandomCompression/RevisionFullBlockInput.lean). The concrete channel-existence development needs its specialization [`ProjectionChannels.Canonical.CanonicalStrongInput`](lean/HaarProjections/RevisionCanonicalEnsemble.lean), where $d_n=\lfloor tkn\rfloor$; the Lean files index the positive input dimension as $n+1$.

**[Partial Lean progress](partial_progress/README.md):** the complete $k=1$ case, finite Haar compression moments at every order up to the ambient dimension, and quantitative Gram/inverse-Gram bounds are proved. For $k\ge2$, the limiting free-law identification, almost-sure moment fluctuations, and sharp spectral-outlier estimates remain unfinished. The random-channel conclusions depending on this input therefore remain conditional.
